## Introduction

KonText is an **advanced corpus query interface** and corpus data **integration platform** built around corpus search engine [Manatee-open](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske). It is written in Python 3 and TypeScript and it runs on any major Linux distribution. The development is maintained by the [Institute of the Czech National Corpus](http://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/).

## Features

* fully **editable query chain**
    * any operation from a user defined sequence (e.g. query -&gt; filter -&gt; sample -&gt; sorting) can be changed
    and the whole sequence is then re-executed.
* multiple search modes:
    * concordance,
    * paradigmatic query,
    * word list
    * keyword analysis
* simple and advanced query types
    * **advanced CQL editor** with **syntax highlighting** and **attribute recognition**
    * **interactive PoS tag composing tool** for positional and key-value tagsets
    * customizable query suggestions and simple type query refinement (e.g. for homonym disambiguation)
* support for **spoken corpora**
    * defined text segments can be played back as audio
    * KWIC detail with **easily distinguishable speeches**
* rich **concordance view options and tools**
    * any positional attribute can be set as primary
    * multiple ways how to display other attributes
    * **user-defined line groups** - filtering, reviewing groups ratios
    * tokens and KWICs can be connected to external data services (e.g. dictionaries, encyclopedias)
    * individual tokens can be linked to each other using an external service (e.g. for word translation equivalents)
* **rich subcorpus-related functionality**
    * any subcorpus is accesible by other users (in case they obtain a URL, otherwise the subcorpus is not discoverable by default)
      * once a public description is set, the subcorpus can be discovered on the "public subcorpora" page
    * text types metadata can be gradually refined to a specific subcorpus ("which publishers are there in case only *fiction* is selected?")
    * a **custom text types ratio** can be defined ("give me 20% fiction and 80% journalism")
    * unused subcorpora can be archived (URLs with the subcorpus are still valid) or completely removed (URLs will become invalid)
    * searching within a subcorpous can be further refined with ad-hoc text type selection
    * a subcorpus can be created with respect to corpora aligned ("give me fiction in Czech but only if there is an English translation for it")
* **frequency distribution**
    * univariate
        * positional attributes (including tuples of multiple attributes per token)
        * structural attributes
    * **multivariate distribution** (2 dimensions) for both positional and structural attributes
* collocation analysis
* **persistent URLs** - any result page can be easily shared even if the original query is megabytes long
* access to **previous queries**, named queries
* convenient corpus access
    * finding corpus by a keyword (tag), size, description
    * adding corpus to **favorites** (incl. subcorpora, aligned corpora)
* saving result to Excel, CSV, XML, JSONL, TXT
* [HTTP API](https://github.com/czcorpus/kontext/wiki/HTTP-API) access


## Internal features

* modern client-side application (written in TypeScript, event stream architecture, React components, extensible)
* server-side written using the [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/) framework with fully **decoupled background concordance/frequency/collocation calculation** (using an integrated [Rq](https://python-rq.org/) worker server)
* modular code design with dynamically loadable plug-ins providing custom functionality implementation (e.g. custom database
adapters, authentication method, corpus listing widgets, HTTP session management)
   * integrability with existing information systems


## Installation

### Docker

Running KonText as a set of Docker containers is the most convenient and flexible way. Docker Compose V2 is required. To run a basic
configuration instance (i.e. no MySQL/MariaDB server, no WebSocket server) use:

```shell
docker compose up
```

To run a production grade instance:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mysql.yml --env-file .env.mysql up
```

(the `.env.mysql` allows configuring custom MySQL/MariaDB credentials and KonText configuration file)


### Manual installation

#### Key requirements

* Python *3.6* (or newer)
* [Manatee](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske) corpus search engine - version *2.167.8* and onwards (for KonText *v0.17*, Manatee *v2.2xx* is recommended)
* a key-value storage
    * [Redis](http://redis.io/) (recommended), [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) (supported), custom implementations possible
* a task queue - [Rq](https://python-rq.org/)
* HTTP proxy server
  + [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) (recommended), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/),...


For Ubuntu OS users, it is recommended to use the [install script](scripts/install/install.py) which should
perform most of the actions necessary to install and run KonText. For other Linux distributions we recommend
running KonText within a container or a virtual machine. Please refer to the [doc/INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md)
file for details.
