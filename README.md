[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/czcorpus/kontext.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/czcorpus/kontext)

## Important note

Please note that due to [Python 2 EOL](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), KonText **version 0.13.x is the last one running in Python 2**. It means that the **next release** (planned for Q1 2020) **will run only in Python 3**. The upgrade won't require any data/configuration change in KonText. The only action needed will be an installation of py3 versions of KonText dependencies and making sure Gunicorn and Celery systemd (or equivalent) configurations point to py3 versions of respective programs (e.g. by removing py2 versions and then installing py3 ones).

## Introduction

KonText is an **advanced corpus query interface** and corpus data integration middleware built around corpus search engine [Manatee-open](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske). The development is maintained by the [Institute of the Czech National Corpus](http://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/).

## Features

### new features

* fully **editable query chain**
    * any operation from a user defined sequence (e.g. query -&gt; filter -&gt; sample -&gt; sorting) can be changed
    and the whole sequence is then re-executed.
* **advanced CQL editor** with **syntax highlighting** and **attribute recognition**
* support for **spoken corpora**
    * defined concordance segments can be played back as audio
    * KWIC detail provides a custom rendering with **easily distinguishable speeches**
* support for **user-defined line groups**
    * user can define custom numeric tags attached to concordance lines, filter out other lines, review groups ratios
* **improved subcorpus creation**
    * user can easily examine corpus structure by selecting some text types and see how other text type attributes
      availability changed ("which publishers are there in case only *fiction* is selected?")
    * a **custom text types ratio** can be defined ("give me 20% fiction and 80% journalism")
    * a sub-corpus can be created by a custom CQL expression
    * a sub-corpus can be published so other users can access it
    * subcorpora are backed up as CQL queries which makes further modification/restoring possible
* **frequency distribution**
    * **2-dimensional frequency distribution** for both positional and structural attributes
    * result caching decreases time required to navigate between pages
    * on the multilevel frequency distribution page, starting word can be specified for multi-word KWICs
* **persistent URL for any query** - you can send a link to someone even if the query string was megabytes long
* access to **previous queries**, named queries
* **access to favorite corpora** (subcorpora, aligned corpora)
* **interactive PoS tag tool** - in case of positional PoS tag formats an interactive tool can be used to write tag queries
* a concordance/frequency/collocation listing can be **saved in Excel format** (xlsx)
* concordance tokens and KWICs can be connected to external data services (e.g. dictionaries, encyclopedias)
* a correct (i.e. the one calculating only with selected text types) i.p.m. can be calculated on-demand for ad-hoc subcorpora
* integrability with external data resources (e.g. dictionaries, media libraries)



### internal features

* server-side written as a **WSGI application**
* modern client-side application (event stream architecture, React components, extensible, written in TypeScript)
* modular code design with dynamically loadable plug-ins providing custom functionality implementation (e.g. custom database
adapters, authentication method, corpus listing widgets, HTTP session management)
* fully **decoupled background concordance/frequency/collocation calculation** based on the
[Celery task queue](http://www.celeryproject.org/)  (alternatively, Python's *multiprocessing* package can be used)
* improved logging, error processing and debugging support
* improved code documentation


## Requirements

* WSGI-compatible server
    * [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) (recommended), [uWsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (tested)
* Rerverse proxy server
  + [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) (recommended), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) (tested)
* Python *2.7* and:
    * [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) Template Engine
    * [lxml](http://lxml.de/) library
    * [werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) library (provides WSGI middleware)
    * [PyICU](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU) library (optional but preferred)
    * [markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) library (optional, for formatted corpora references)
    * [openpyxl](https://pythonhosted.org/openpyxl/) library (optional, for XLSX export)
* corpus search engine [Manatee](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske)
    * versions from *2.83.3* to *2.158.8* are supported (the latest one is highly recommended); unless there is an incompatible change in Manatee, newer versions should work too
* a key-value storage
    * any custom implementation ([Redis](http://redis.io/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) backends are available by default)
* (optional) [Celery task queue](http://www.celeryproject.org/) task queue for (asynchronous) background calculations and maintenance tasks
