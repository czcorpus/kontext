"""
This module contains a specification for the server-side of the
'taghelper' widget which provides an interactive way how to write
a PoS tag within a CQL query.

Please note that the specification is more strict than necessary -
there is a concept of 'loaders' and 'fetchers' which is completely
avoidable but we suggest implementers to adopt this approach and
reuse existing 'default_taghelper' plug-in with custom loaders and
fetchers as it should be much easier to accomplish than writing
a new version of 'taghelper'.

    AbstractTagsetInfoLoader wraps all the implementation
    details and concrete data format properties of
    a tag set into a general interface Tag Helper plug-in
    can work with.

    The instance is expected to be bound with a concrete corpus.
    I.e. in case multiple corpora support the same tagset, multiple
    loaders will be instantiated.

    Note: Having two methods may seem superfluous as the initial
    values can be seen as getting a variant for an empty query.
    But there is another important difference between the two
    methods. A plug-in developer may want get_initial_values
    to return all the possible values as defined in tagset
    specification no matter how tag-rich a respective corpus is
    (i.e. the corpus may not contain values for some property
    at all but we want it in the selection anyway).
    The 'get_variant' method on the other hand is expected to
    be purely data-driven - i.e. it returns data based on
    actual corpus contents.

        E.g. let's say we have the following variants in a corpus: AAB, ACD, BAB, CAA
        and user selects A.. Then we want to return [A, C] for the second position and
        [B, D] for the third position as possible values.
        For key-value tagsets it works in the same way - just imagine K1=A, K2=A,
        K3=B instead of AAB, K1=A, K2=C, K3=D instead of ACD etc.

    enable the plug-in no matter what corpus in on and make some additional
