class AbstractConcPersistence(object):
    """
    Custom conc_persistence plug-in implementations should inherit from this class.

    Concordance persistence plug-in is expected to store current query and provide
    access to it via a string identifier.

    Please note that by 'query' we actually mean two representations:
    1) data entered by user via query form (query, additional options,
       checked checkboxes of text types,...)
    2) encoded version of (1) (controller's self.args.q attribute)

    The essential part is to store values from (2) but for a more convenient
    user experience (1) should be stored too as it allows easy restoring
    of a state of respective forms.
