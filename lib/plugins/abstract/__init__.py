"""
This package contains base classes for miscellaneous plug-ins
implementation. Although KonText uses the duck typing approach
here (i.e. you can the abstract classes as long as you provide
a compatible interface) it is recommended to extend these
classes to keep the plug-in implementation clear and consistent.
