"""
Token detail plug-in is used for attaching (an external) information
to any token in a concordance. Typically, this can be used to attach
dictionaries, encyclopediae to individual tokens, named entities etc.

The plug-in is composed of three main general components:

1) **backend** represents an adapter communicating with an (external)
   service

2) **client frontend** visually interprets the data provided by the backend,

3) **server frontend** exports backend data to be readable by the client
   frontend and specifies which client-side component is responsible for
   rendering the contents.

In general it is expected to be possible to mix these (especially backend vs. frontend)
in different ways - e.g. RawHtmlFrontend is probably usable along with any
backend producing raw HTML output.

Please note that in case of this plug-in the key to customization lies in
frontends and backends. It means that in case you need a special functionality,
it will be probably enough to extend this plug-in by an empty class and
add your frontend or backend (depending on what needs to be customized).
