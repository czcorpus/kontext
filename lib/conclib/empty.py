    InitialConc represents a concordance which has always zero rows
    but it is also expected to be calculated further. It is sometimes
    used by KonText as an initial replacement for the manatee.Concordance
    in case it is reasonable to expect the actual calculation to take a long time
    before any (initial few rows) data arrives. In such case, the frontend uses
    InitialConc while the backend worker calculates actual data.
