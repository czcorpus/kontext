"""
This module contains localization-related helper functions:

* number formatting
* date and time formatting
* string encoding (used mainly to ensure utf-8 is used even if
  Manatee uses a corpus with different encoding)

There are two important facts to consider when dealing with
internationalisation of KonText:

1. In WSGI environment, standard 'locale' cannot be used as
   it works per-process while WSGI typically operates in multi-threaded mode.
2. Manatee module contains method set_encoding() but it is module-global
   which is useless in multi-threaded environment as multiple requests are
   processed using the same module.
