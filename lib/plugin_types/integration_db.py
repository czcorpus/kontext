    Integration DB plugin allows sharing a single database connection pool across multiple plugins
    which can be convenient in case KonText is integrated into an existing information system with
    existing user accounts, corpora information, settings storage etc.

    Even if it is not stated explicitly the interface is tailored for use with SQL databases
    where terms like 'cursor', 'commit', 'rollback' are common. But in general, it should be possible
    to wrap also some NoSQL databases if needed.

    Also please note that "integration database" is not to be meant for a standalone KonText
    installations. KonText itself (with default plug-ins) uses the DB (aka KeyValueStorage) plugin
    for its operations. But if you have an existing information system and do not want redundant
    information in KonText's db, the "integration_db" is the way to go.
