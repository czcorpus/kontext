"""
Query history plug-in works as a backend for the 'recent queries' function.
This should not be confused with 'query_persistence'. Query_persistence stores
each query under a "query ID". The ID depends in general only on
the query itself (imagine something like 'all query args -> JSON -> sha1').
It means that two different users may generate the very same query ID
in case the queries are the same. The query_history takes the ID, adds
a timestamp and (optionally) a permanent name and stores it for a specific
user.
