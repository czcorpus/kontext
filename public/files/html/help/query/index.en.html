    <h2>Simple query</h2>

    <p>
        This query type finds in its default setting all occurrences of the input word intepreted as a word form, lemma or sublemma (if lemma and/or sublemma are available for the given corpus). This behaviour can be changed by selection of the default attribute that is available in the "specify parameters" tab under the input line. Oher settings in this tab are case-sensitivity and using <a href="https://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/en:pojmy:regularni_vyrazy">regular expressions</a> in the search. A suitable combination of these settings supersedes the number of other query types available in previous versions of KonText, except for the CQL query that now corresponds to the <i>Advanced query</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the SYN2020 and SYN_V9 corpora, there is also a special add-on available for suggesting other possible variants of the input word.
        This is indicated by a blue background of the word and activated by Ctrl+clicking on it. After selecting the individual variant, its (sub)lemma intepretation
        is changed in the query. This is indicated by a red background of the "Query interpretation" option above the input line. The add-on is available only for the simple query mode.
    </p>

    <h2>Advanced query</h2>

    <p>
        A complex query language for full-fledged work with all the annotation available for a corpus. It corresponds to the CQL query from the previous versions of KonText and requires a knowledge of the <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/corpus-querying/">CQL</a> query language.
