CHANGELOG

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.x

- config.xml is now expected to reside in ./conf/config.xml

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6.x

- moved from CGI to WSGI
- improved core KonText architecture
- improved plug-in architecture
- rewritten default plug-ins to be a fully-fledged alternative to highly
  customized ucnk_* plug-ins
- new plug-in *live_attributes* allows interactive selection of searched text
  properties for subcorpora
- initial support for additional action/API groups with custom URL prefix
- concordance lines can be manually selected and filtered
- rewritten query history (now also available as a drop-down box attached to
  the query input field)
- query peristence
  - query length (including filters etc.) is no more an issue (like in
    *bonito-open* and previous KonText versions); KonText
    is able to store a query of any length via new *conc_persistence* plug-in;
    the plug-in is optional which means in case no implementation is available,
    everything works like in previous versions
- minor user interface improvements
    - make aligned corpus primary by one click
    - corpus tree widget now contains a search box
- XLSX export of concordances

0.2.x
